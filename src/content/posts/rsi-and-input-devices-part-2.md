This is part 2 of [RSI and Input Devices](/posts/rsi-and-input-devices).

## Logitech MX Vertical Ergonomic Mouse

At first I was rejected the idea of using the [Logitech MX Vertical Ergonomic Mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse.910-005447.html)
I had tried the one my roommate had and found the scroll-wheel to be subpar,
though after continued pain from using my MX Ergo Plus I decided to buy one off
amazon. Even though I didn't care for the scroll-wheel on the mouse, I noticed
the pain in my hand and wrist decreased, and after a few days pretty much went
away. This wasn't the result I was expecting, but it's one I'll take. It's also
nice to have a USB-C port on an input device rather than micro-USB. While I
haven't been using it for a long, and can't say for sure it will solve my RSI
issues, I'm tentatively accepting that it's going to be my daily driver mouse.
